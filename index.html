        Hi! This is the very first, bare-bones version of the soon-to-be Chronicler website. There's pretty much nothing here right now, but in the future I'm planning to add more stuff, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Descriptions of Kin and Cultures of Arden Eld</li>
            <li>Descriptions, abilities and art for Jobs</li>
            <li>Foe statblocks for DMs</li>
        </ul>
        And much, much more! Though I think I at least need to get this website up and running haha :) <br><br>
        Welp, see you later! I promise Chronicler <i>will</i> look prettier some day.
